# ♟️ Chess Game Project

## 📚 Overview
This project is a **Java-based Chess Game Application** developed as part of the TCP2201 Object-Oriented Programming course at Multimedia University.  
It allows two players to play a complete game of chess with basic move validation, winning conditions, and a simple graphical display.  

**Design Approach:**  
- Applied **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)** concepts throughout the codebase.  
- Structured according to the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern for clear separation of concerns and maintainability.

## 🚀 Features
- ♟️ **New Game**: Start a new chess match between two players
- 💾 **Save Game**: Save the current game state
- 📂 **Load Game**: Load a previously saved game
- 🧠 **Move Validation**: Only legal chess moves are allowed (based on piece type)
- 🏆 **Winning Condition**: King is eaten by opponent
- 🎯 **Turn Management**: Alternates moves between Blue and Red players

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java** (Core Language)
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction
- **Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)** techniques: Use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern for UI separation
- **Simple GUI** built with Java Swing/AWT
